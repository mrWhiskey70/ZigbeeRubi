# Architecture Compliance Matrix

This file defines the architecture rules that are enforced by `check_arch_invariants.sh`.

## Severity policy

- `High`: hard-blocking in CI and local gate.
- `Medium`: hard-blocking in CI and local gate.
- `Low`: non-blocking by default (warning), can be made blocking with `ARCH_BLOCKING_SEVERITIES=high,medium,low`.

## Rule matrix

## Exception mechanism

- File: `ADR_EXCEPTIONS.md`
- Format: machine-readable HTML comment per exception:
  - `<!-- ARCH_EXCEPTION: RULE=<RULE_ID> PATH=<regex> EXPIRES=<YYYY-MM-DD> STATUS=active ADR=<ADR-ID> -->`
- Expired exceptions are ignored automatically by the gate.

## Local usage

```bash
bash ./check_arch_invariants.sh
```

Strict mode (including low severity):

```bash
ARCH_BLOCKING_SEVERITIES=high,medium,low bash ./check_arch_invariants.sh
```
